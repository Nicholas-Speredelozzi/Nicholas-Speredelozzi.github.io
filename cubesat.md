## CubeSat Senior Design

**Role:** Lead Environmental Engineer & Requirements Developer  
**Institution:** Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University  
**Mission Concept:** Space Situational Awareness in GEO  

---

## Project Overview

This project involved the conceptual design of a 3U CubeSat intended to conduct space situational awareness operations in Geosynchronous Earth Orbit. The design required multidisciplinary coordination across structural, thermal, power, and mission subsystems.

## My Responsibilities

- Developed and maintained system-level and subsystem requirements
- Led thermal control subsystem design
- Conducted environmental risk analysis
- Supported subsystem interface definition
- Contributed to trade studies affecting spacecraft configuration

---

## Technical Focus Areas

### Systems Engineering
- Requirements traceability across work breakdown structure
- Verification planning
- SWaP-C considerations

### Environmental & Thermal Design
- Space environment exposure analysis
- Passive thermal control strategy
- Material selection considerations

### Integration Considerations
- Subsystem packaging within 3U form factor
- Interface alignment between structural and thermal components
- Configuration consistency across design iterations
