## CubeSat Senior Design

**Role:** Lead Environmental Engineer & Requirements Developer  
**Institution:** Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University  
**Mission Concept:** Space Situational Awareness in GEO

## Project Overview

My capstone project is focused on the conceptual design of a 3U CubeSat intended to conduct space situational awareness (SSA) operations in Geosynchronous Earth Orbit. Our group is comprised of 8 students with unique roles contributing to the design and integration of the spacecraft.  
The primary objective of the mission is to perform optical SSA on all objects in the geostationary belt, to include both active satellites & debris. To accomplish this task, the spacecraft will take multi-image, inertial stare collects of GEO objects and identify resident space objects (RSOs) captured in each image.  
Ultimately, the CubeSat will obtain estimated orbital trajectories of each RSO and create an SSA catalog of the GEO belt. Additionally, the mission lifetime & total cost cap for the project are set at 2 years & $200,000 split between build cost, labor hours, and testing facility usage.  
To track our progress, the project follows a formal systems engineering lifecycle, with four milestone reviews spread from August 2025 to April 2026. So far, we have completed the Systems Requirements Review, Preliminary Design Review, and Critical Design Review, with Operational Readiness Review on the horizon to be completed in the coming months.
