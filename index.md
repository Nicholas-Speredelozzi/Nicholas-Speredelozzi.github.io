## **Professional Summary**

Aerospace Engineering senior at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, specializing in astronautics & space systems. Through a combination of academic design projects, hands-on lab experiments, and a multi-term internship at the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), I've gained experience in spacecraft systems engineering, governmental engineering environments, and multidisciplinary, integration-focused teams. 

Actively pursuing entry-level roles in spacecraft systems integration, launch operations, and aerospace mission planning.

This page includes a collection of technical projects & experiences I've gained throughout my academic career. In-depth breakdowns, takeaways, and specific contributions are linked to each title, in addition to a 3D modeling showcase near the bottom of the page. Thanks for stopping by!
